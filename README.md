# BulkyBook

Our system features a straightforward category management system, empowering users to effortlessly create, update, and delete categories. Each category is composed of two essential components: a name and a displayed order for easy organization.

On the home page, users can access a neatly organized table that conveniently displays all available categories. To ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, we've implemented AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) technology. This ensures that the user interface remains responsive, even when retrieving data that may take some time.

It's worth noting that all the relevant endpoints for managing categories are hosted within the BulkyBook.API, ensuring a centralized and secure location for category-related operations.

In order to interact with the endpoints implemented in the BulkyBook.API, every client request is made using an HttpClient. This enables seamless communication between the client application and the API, ensuring that data can be retrieved, updated, or deleted efficiently.

Furthermore, we've implemented robust security measures to safeguard the endpoints. To access any of these endpoints, each request must include a secret key. This security protocol helps protect sensitive data and ensures that only authorized users can perform actions on the categories. This multi-layered security approach enhances the overall integrity and confidentiality of the system.
